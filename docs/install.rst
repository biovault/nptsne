Installing
==========

This release supports 4 python versions (3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9) on three platforms: Windows, Ubuntu, Macos

On Windows and Linux acceleration is performed using compute shaders. On Macos, due to the lack of compute shader support, tSNE uses a rasterized implementation with a lower performance.

Windows,MacOS,Linux: install from PyPi using: **pip install nptsne**. `The PyPi page. <https://pypi.org/project/nptsne/>`_
